## Why Videre?

Sometimes you just need to quickly connect to a database and browse your data. Videre is designed for exactly that — a lightweight tool for when you want to inspect tables without any setup overhead.

### Simple

Connect to your database, browse your tables. That's the core experience. We focus on doing this one thing well.

- **Tab-based interface** — Open multiple tables side by side
- **Keyboard navigation** — `⌘/Ctrl + T`, `⌘/Ctrl + W`, `⌘/Ctrl + [1-9]`
- **Pagination** — Navigate through large tables
- **Themes** — Light and dark mode with multiple color themes

### Private & Secure

Your data is yours. Videre runs entirely on your machine.

- **Zero telemetry** — No tracking, no analytics, no data collection
- **Local only** — Your credentials and data never leave your machine
- **Minimal dependencies** — We keep the dependency count low to reduce supply chain risks
- **Open source** — The code is fully auditable

## What You Can Inspect

Videre is currently **read-only** — perfect for browsing and understanding your data without risk of accidental changes.

- **Tables** — Browse data with pagination
- **Indexes** — View index configurations
- **Roles** — See database roles and permissions
- **Foreign keys** — Understand table relationships
- **Views** — Inspect view data

**Can you vibe code this?** Yeah, probably! But I already spent the time and tokens so you don't have to :)
